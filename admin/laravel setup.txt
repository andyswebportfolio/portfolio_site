Register the Auto Loader

(add the path for your created file that contains the laravel setup, then the rest of the existing address. Should look like this: (your file)/vendor/autoload or similar

Do the same thing for line 47 (or similar) ‘run the application’


8. Export then import your sql tables in to the host
OR
Use SSH Access , navigate to the folder you created with the laravel framework
php artisan migrate
that should copy everything for you and is easier.


Now the site should work =D
